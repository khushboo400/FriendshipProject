<p style="color:white; font-size:20px;" onclick="hello()" id="ka">A gurdwara ("door to the guru") is a place of assembly and worship for Sikhs. People from all faiths, and those who do not profess any faith, are welcomed in Sikh gurdwaras. Each gurdwara has a Darbar Sahib where the current and everlasting guru of the Sikhs, the scripture Guru Granth Sahib, is placed on a takhat (an elevated throne) in a prominent central position. The raagis (who sing Ragas) recite, sing and explain, the verses from the Guru Granth Sahib, in the presence of the congregation.

All gurdwaras have a langar hall, where people can eat free vegetarian food served by volunteers at the gurdwara.They may also have a medical facility room, library, nursery, classroom, meeting rooms, playground, sports ground, a gift shop, and finally a repair shop. A gurdwara can be identified from a distance by tall flagpoles bearing the Nishan Sahib, the Sikh flag.
