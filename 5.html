<p style="font-size:18px; color:AntiqueWhite  ;">Social is a space that blends the best of the office and the café. Combining work and play, it's an urban hangout designed to take you offline while still keeping you connected. Social is a collaborative workspace, a hub for artists and innovators.
An original vintage tram brought straight from its place of origin, Kolkata, serves as its entrance. The game-changing brand ‘Social’, an all-day cafe and bar, which opens to the public in the back lane of Sector 7 in Chandigarh on January 4, brings to the city design elements which are quirky, but functional, designed as an ideal space for work and play. Spread across two levels and a 10,000 sq. ft. area, ‘Sector 7 Social’ creates a series of diverse experiences for the guests. From the tram entrance to tight pockets of spaces leading to a large amphitheatre like courtyard with stadium seating and an outdoor bar, Sector 7 Social is a maze of spaces, seamlessly integrated with a thread of experiences, which the promoters describe as “an architectural pun on the planned city of Chandigarh.” Sector 7 Social has been brought to Chandigarh in a partnership between Impresario Entertainment & Hospitality Pvt. Ltd., founded by Riyaaz Amlani aand Kiran Salaskar, which also owns the brands Mocha – Coffees & Conversations,  Smoke House Deli (the transformation of refined dining into casual chic), Salt Water Café (a contemporary take on timeless European cafés) and The Tasting Room (quaint wine haven, on the one hand and Chandigarh based Aelius Entertainment & Hospitality Pvt. Ltd., which also runs popular restaurants and lounges like Swagath, Mainland China, Satva Lounge, S-Lounge and Karim’s in the city. This first outlet in Chandigarh is Social’s 18th  in the country after becoming wildly popular in Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi.</p>
